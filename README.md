JavaScript Quiz Application

Introduction:
Welcome to my JavaScript Quiz Application! This project demonstrates my understanding of the Document Object Model and my ability to implement its features effectively. I had the freedom to choose the topic, material, and purpose of the web application, and with that I chose to have fun and create a application that will test how my Per Scholas Peers know me!

Objectives:
- Utilize DOM properties, methods, and techniques to create a dynamic web application.
- Use BOM properties, methods, and techniques to enhance the dynamic nature of the application.
- Demonstrate proficiency with event-driven programming and DOM events.
- Implement basic form validation using a combination of HTML validation attributes and DOM-event-driven JavaScript validation.

Features: 
- DOM Manipulation
- Cache at least one element using getElementById.
- Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll.
- Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once (e.g., firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.).
- Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task (e.g., loops).
- Create at least one element using createElement.
- Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM.
- Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content.
- Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.
- Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions using the style or classList properties.
- Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction.

Event Handling:
- Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event handler functions.
- Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.

Form Validation:
- Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.
- Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation (this can be the same form or input as the one above, but should include event-based validation in addition to the HTML attribute validation).

Instructions:
I created a single-page web application with the topic and content of my choice. I followed the technical requirements listed above. I focused on finishing the minimum requirements first and then added more features and complexity as time permitted.

Future Improvements:
Databases:
- Including a database to score each user's attempt and rank them with others.

Installing/Usage:
- clone the github respitory of https://github.com/saidmsajady/308_SBA.git
- and have Node.js installed on your machine.

Languages:
JavaScript 
- The primary language for its versatility and wide use in web development.
Node.js 
- Enables running JavaScript code outside the browser, facilitating testing and execution.
